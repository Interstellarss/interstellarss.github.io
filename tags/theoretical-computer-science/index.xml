    <description><![CDATA[From part 1 we can recognize what DFA and NFA look like and know the equivalence between them. In &ldquo;From Infinite Automata to Regular Languages&rdquo; we know the equivalence between DFA, NFA and regular expressions and regular languages, and there are some tools such as pump priming and Ardens Lemma to either prove or convert them. We have made some progress in the &lsquo;art&rsquo; level so far, so we might]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This article can be seen as &ldquo;from infinite automata to regular expressions&rdquo; of this additional article, mainly to provide JAVA to achieve from DFA to RE conversion. Because the code is copied from the assignment, I don&rsquo;t know if there will be any copyright problem, but this is not considered commercial use, and some of the code is written by me, so it should not be a big problem.

    <description><![CDATA[Some understanding of the formal definition of DFA and NFA, as well as the proof of regular operation closure and the equivalence of DFA and NFA, that is, the story of DFA belongs to NFA, is the special case and regular story yet. Some insights into deterministic finite automata (DFA) For deterministic finite automatons, we can give the corresponding formal definition, borrowed here from the one given by professor in]]></description>
