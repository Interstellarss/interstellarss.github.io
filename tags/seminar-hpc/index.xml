    <description><![CDATA[This time, I brought the first draft of the paper to be submitted for the seminar, which is a way to be lazy.
A brief Overview on Shared Memory Parallelism in Parallel Computing 1. Why parallel? To speed up, while we are facing the limitation of current transistors and increasing energy consumption. Now that we know it is necessary and lots of privilege besides you need to reconstruct your program yourself rather than automatically distributed by APIs in a serial way.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I&rsquo;m going to start a new series on the Theo and Network series that I&rsquo;m currently working on, which is the parallel computing series that I&rsquo;ve seen so far. This semester, I was assigned the topic &ldquo;Shared Memory Parallelization&rdquo;, which is the title of the seminar. Because I need to submit a paper and do a presentation at the end, I think I can also open a new series to]]></description>
