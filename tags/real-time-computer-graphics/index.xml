    <description><![CDATA[In fact, many times we see these renderings are really amazing things, such as some terrain seems to be three-dimensional, but in fact can be generated by two-dimensional, that is, for each pixel point to give a height value, these height values constitute a column of points and can be converted into a two-dimensional image to store, when needed, the corresponding terrain can be generated from this picture.
As for the introduction, we are only concerned with using normal distribution or diamond square to assign values, terrain generator about color and normal value images we will talk about later.]]></description>
